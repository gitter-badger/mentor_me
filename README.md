### Self-taught
_**No software developer is an island.**_

As a self-taught programmer I had a unique set of challenges to overcome. Being self-taught meant acquiring skills to be effective at my job, able to communicate domain specific issues with other developers, and building credibility within the industry. To become effective with the multiple languages in a web application I had to find a way to relate to abstract concepts such as datatypes and operators. Another challenge was forming a disciplined approach to stack tracing when I needed to debug my application after it threw an error. In my first collaborative project coding styles clashed that required standardizing a set of style guides. And with a resume that lacks a degree in computer science I rely on a portfolio of applications. In the hurdles listed and the many more not, I've found my greatest personal growth occurs when I listen to the wisdom of developers I respect. So I want to nurture a community that makes these connections accessible.
